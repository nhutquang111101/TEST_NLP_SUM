<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="17" wdcount="8"> By Sept. 8, the system became a depression.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="18" wdcount="11"> It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="19" wdcount="10"> A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.</s>

<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="22" wdcount="23"> Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="23" wdcount="21"> ``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said Thursday.</s>

<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="25" wdcount="13"> But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="26" wdcount="19"> And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="27" wdcount="33"> ``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck said.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="28" wdcount="18"> ``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence pattern.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="29" wdcount="20"> That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="30" wdcount="5"> Eventually, a vortex is created.</s>

<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="34" wdcount="16"> Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,'' he said.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="35" wdcount="18"> ``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere.</s>
<s docid="AP880916-0060" num="36" wdcount="14"> That has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere''.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="22" wdcount="26"> Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement "rider" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="30" wdcount="34"> Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="31" wdcount="33"> However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.</s>

<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="36" wdcount="20"> For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.</s>
<s docid="WSJ891019-0086" num="37" wdcount="35"> Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise.</s>

<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="9" wdcount="42"> The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrade's main downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and the other specialities familiar to McDonald's customers in the West.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="10" wdcount="26"> The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="11" wdcount="19"> Pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onions, and it is served on bread and eaten with the hands.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="12" wdcount="14"> It is sold at fast-food restaurants across the country and costs about a dollar.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="13" wdcount="26"> ``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica,'' said an official of Genex, Yugoslavia's largest state-run enterprise that will operate the McDonald's.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="14" wdcount="23"> John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters, said it was the first of the chain's outlets in a communist country.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="15" wdcount="25"> The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened in Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic, another Genex official.</s>
<s docid="AP880314-0110" num="16" wdcount="23"> Negotiations have been going on for years for expanding the fast-food chain to the Soviet Union, but no agreement has been announced .</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="9" wdcount="36"> Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="10" wdcount="26"> ``I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,'' said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="11" wdcount="27"> People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="12" wdcount="15"> It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="13" wdcount="23"> The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawn crowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before it opened Thursday.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="14" wdcount="23"> Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="15" wdcount="19"> ``No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade has created such a sensation as this one today,'' one policeman said.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="16" wdcount="21"> ``I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade,'' said Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="17" wdcount="18"> ``It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicer and it is not too expensive''.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="18" wdcount="35"> The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald's in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="19" wdcount="32"> ``In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica,'' said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with McDonald's.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="20" wdcount="20"> ``Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav market,'' said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the Genex-McDonald's.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="21" wdcount="15"> ``We want to change customs of the local people used to completly different eating habits''.</s>

<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="23" wdcount="10"> Also, smoking is forbidden and alcohol will not be served.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="24" wdcount="24"> This contrasts sharply with the Balkan and Yugoslav custom of sitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurants and chatting with friends after the meal.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="25" wdcount="33"> The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of $2.57, or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="26" wdcount="31"> Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonald's, suggested that the American restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="27" wdcount="18"> ``However, we will not give up the fight even if we have to lower the prices,'' said Seljami.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="28" wdcount="46"> Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, ``We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe''.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="29" wdcount="11"> McDonald's and Genex contribute $1 million each for the flagship restaurant.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="30" wdcount="16"> They will also share the profits equally even though it will be managed entirely by Yugoslavs.</s>
<s docid="AP880324-0193" num="31" wdcount="16"> The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.</s>

<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="12" wdcount="31"> Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ``gamburgers,'' ``chizburgers'' and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="13" wdcount="27"> The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="14" wdcount="27"> The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed, lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="15" wdcount="18"> The crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later than planned.</s>

<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="19" wdcount="39"> Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="20" wdcount="28"> The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="21" wdcount="33"> Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="22" wdcount="30"> The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="23" wdcount="12"> The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said.</s>

<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="26" wdcount="26"> Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="27" wdcount="25"> Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="28" wdcount="36"> One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="29" wdcount="11"> For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="30" wdcount="22"> Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating ``gamburger''.</s>

<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="36" wdcount="49"> Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos.</s>

<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="39" wdcount="15"> The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger-scalping.</s>
<s docid="AP900131-0200" num="40" wdcount="38"> McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy, meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0136" num="15" wdcount="13"> ``It tastes good, I like it,'' she announced before slowly eating the rest.</s>
<s docid="AP901008-0136" num="16" wdcount="23"> The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to gourmets.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0136" num="24" wdcount="29"> Although Kentucky Fried Chicken has become popular, the average Chinese still regards a meal there as a treat, rather than a convenience, and McDonald's could face the same problems.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0136" num="31" wdcount="31"> Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonald's Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurant's opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.</s>

<s docid="AP901008-0136" num="36" wdcount="40"> A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its ``sweet taste'' - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly used in traditional Chinese cooking .</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="7" wdcount="33"> AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry about a host of obstacles to investing in Russia, Russian officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for McDonald's hamburgers.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="8" wdcount="33"> Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storey office block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well be described as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="9" wdcount="39"> McDonald's proven determination 'to be here for the long term' and to serve Russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for Russian gratitude.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="10" wdcount="29"> Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact that McDonald's gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up a Dollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="11" wdcount="29"> He also thanked McDonald's for providing jobs, a model of western standards for the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what he described as 'the most delicious food'.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="12" wdcount="42"> But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs, musicians playing the balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M - life has been tough for McDonald's since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 3 1/2 years ago.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="13" wdcount="46"> Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonald's in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonald's management, who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="14" wdcount="24"> 'It will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happens to the rouble, what happens to raw materials that we buy.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="15" wdcount="11"> We don't have an estimate of how long it will take.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="16" wdcount="8"> There are too many variables,' said Mr Cohon.</s>
<s docid="FT932-5869" num="17" wdcount="36"> Apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor, the McDonald's office block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate hard currency alongside the mountains of roubles made from selling hamburgers .</s>

<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="22" wdcount="24"> Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington.</s>

<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="32" wdcount="22"> Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.</s>
<s docid="AP880817-0040" num="33" wdcount="8"> Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said.</s>

<s docid="AP880818-0023" num="12" wdcount="11"> Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a Democrat.</s>

<s docid="AP880818-0023" num="21" wdcount="17"> The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0023" num="22" wdcount="31"> The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The Candidate'' sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.</s>
<s docid="AP880818-0023" num="23" wdcount="23"> Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.</s>

<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="9" wdcount="22"> Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="10" wdcount="46"> Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="11" wdcount="33"> Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="12" wdcount="13"> ``Let's go on to victory''! Quayle exhorted, as the crowd erupted in cheers.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="13" wdcount="29"> The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="14" wdcount="20"> Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side''.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="15" wdcount="20"> The two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="16" wdcount="18"> But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened Quayle's candidacy just as it was launched.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="17" wdcount="2"> Retired Maj.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="18" wdcount="46"> Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,'' the News reported.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="19" wdcount="18"> Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="20" wdcount="38"> A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="21" wdcount="18"> Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="22" wdcount="20"> Quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="23" wdcount="28"> It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor, rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of John F. Kennedy.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="24" wdcount="20"> Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech, saying he was proud of the six years he served.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="25" wdcount="15"> He also addressed his relative anonymity: ``Many this week have asked, `Who is Dan Quayle'?</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="26" wdcount="11"> The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will''.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="27" wdcount="13"> Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="28" wdcount="27"> Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="29" wdcount="10"> ``He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="30" wdcount="20"> ... That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis, and he is running for president,'' Dole said.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="31" wdcount="32"> Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the nomination, said Quayle would ``bring vim, vigor and vitality'' to the party and would bring ``sparks and voltage to this campaign''.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="32" wdcount="15"> Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="33" wdcount="14"> Others, notably Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they could not.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="34" wdcount="15"> But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to be daunted by the prospect.</s>
<s docid="AP880819-0023" num="35" wdcount="8"> ``Miracles do happen,'' he told his party .</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="10" wdcount="28"> Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="11" wdcount="14"> The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect July 1.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="12" wdcount="18"> Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov.</s>

<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="14" wdcount="29"> Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="15" wdcount="24"> ``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="16" wdcount="7"> ``He was in fact the chief investigator.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="17" wdcount="7"> He helped get the unit set up.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="18" wdcount="15"> (But) it would not have been before 1971,'' Smith said Friday in a telephone interview.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="19" wdcount="6"> ``We formally began operations July 1''.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="20" wdcount="17"> Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate'' and said his staff had written the document.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="21" wdcount="7"> ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="22" wdcount="15"> I didn't hold that job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="23" wdcount="21"> Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap shot''.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="24" wdcount="32"> Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="25" wdcount="16"> Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attending Indiana University Law School at the time.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="26" wdcount="18"> M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News, helped arrange his job interview with the state.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="27" wdcount="13"> Evans worked for Eugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="28" wdcount="28"> ``At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors or use any influence,'' said Evans, now with the National Journalism Center in Washington, D.C.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="29" wdcount="9"> ``He wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="30" wdcount="19"> He was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="31" wdcount="6"> It's a nothing story,'' Evans said.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="32" wdcount="22"> Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy Sendak.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="33" wdcount="34"> Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints and inquiries were handled by me.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="34" wdcount="15"> The legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle''.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="35" wdcount="8"> Her statement was released by the Quayle campaign.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="36" wdcount="26"> The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="37" wdcount="26"> In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a ``Vietnam-era veteran'' in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="38" wdcount="18"> Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped the reference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="39" wdcount="23"> In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was ``on active duty for several periods during his tenure'' in the Guard.</s>
<s docid="AP880826-0226" num="40" wdcount="19"> The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp each summer .</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="9" wdcount="32"> Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="10" wdcount="33"> Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="11" wdcount="48"> Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="12" wdcount="15"> ``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="13" wdcount="18"> One thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="14" wdcount="35"> ... With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals,'' said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the American presidency.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="15" wdcount="10"> Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="16" wdcount="36"> When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle would ``make an outstanding vice president'' and had been ``tempered by steel'' as he weathered the early furor over his military service, academic record and personal life.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="17" wdcount="21"> The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to the president.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="18" wdcount="14"> But he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give Quayle.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="19" wdcount="25"> Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council, and that he assumes he'll have a role in the administration's anti-drug efforts.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="20" wdcount="12"> ``I will be a very close adviser to the president,'' Quayle said.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="21" wdcount="8"> But that's not the way everyone sees it.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="22" wdcount="30"> Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns, Barilleaux notes.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="23" wdcount="14"> ``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="24" wdcount="10"> He doesn't have his own big reputation on Capitol Hill.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="25" wdcount="16"> ... Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush,'' Barilleaux says.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="26" wdcount="27"> ``They're going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space council, drug task force, but he's going to be a man on the outside ...</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="27" wdcount="17"> not a man who's going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a pro forma basis''.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="28" wdcount="33"> But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="29" wdcount="3"> ``Vindication demands that.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="30" wdcount="14"> Both of them will want to prove how right the decision was,'' Mahe says.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="31" wdcount="28"> Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="32" wdcount="12"> Even some members of Quayle's own party were dismayed at Bush's choice.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="33" wdcount="34"> Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I didn't live in this century''.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="34" wdcount="20"> Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, says Quayle, while ``not the world's leading intellectual,'' is not ``a complete dummy''.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="35" wdcount="14"> He was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared, Ornstein says.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="36" wdcount="4"> ``I think he's immature.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="37" wdcount="5"> He's not stupid,'' Ornstein says.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="38" wdcount="35"> But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate,'' Ornstein says.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="39" wdcount="10"> ``That's going to give him a good deal to overcome.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="40" wdcount="11"> It's going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="41" wdcount="8"> That's going to be difficult, given the office''.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="42" wdcount="23"> Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see parallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="43" wdcount="26"> The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by Dwight Eisenhower to appease the party's right wing, and Agnew was seen as a political nonentity.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="44" wdcount="18"> ``The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, as Nixon did with Agnew in 1968,'' Hess says.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="45" wdcount="38"> ``However, Quayle has four years to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned, how much he's acted responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988''.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="46" wdcount="8"> Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="47" wdcount="19"> After the controversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from his Bush handlers, saying he would be his own man.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="48" wdcount="25"> He became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from Washington and to deliver the party's scripted message.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="49" wdcount="7"> Soon, he dropped off the front pages.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="50" wdcount="36"> And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news, he played the role of loyal No. 2 and even trumpeted his new anonymity.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="51" wdcount="26"> ``We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="52" wdcount="9"> That's what we're supposed to be,'' he told reporters.</s>
<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="53" wdcount="31"> That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a Bush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants ``a private adviser, whose experience and opinion he respected ...</s>

<s docid="AP881114-0006" num="55" wdcount="15"> ``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone,'' Mahe says.</s>

<s docid="SJMN91-06140099" num="30" wdcount="32"> Hayden Schenkel, chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel, says, "Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States.</s>

<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="12" wdcount="30"> The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="13" wdcount="49"> Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the De Soto store.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="14" wdcount="17"> Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="15" wdcount="22"> His example is followed by other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="16" wdcount="23"> Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out''.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="17" wdcount="11"> By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations throughout the company.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="18" wdcount="28"> Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to Sam, as he is called.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="19" wdcount="15"> To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, ``Rule No.1 is the customer is always right.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="20" wdcount="13"> Rule No.2 says just in case the customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1''.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="21" wdcount="20"> If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are because that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="22" wdcount="23"> He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="23" wdcount="10"> He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="24" wdcount="12"> He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that hospitality to customers is crucial.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="25" wdcount="13"> He preaches it in person or via high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="26" wdcount="27"> Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="27" wdcount="13"> One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton is the fortune he's amassed.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="28" wdcount="22"> A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything'' not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest people.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="29" wdcount="17"> The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.</s>

<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="34" wdcount="26"> He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="35" wdcount="24"> After serving three years in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="36" wdcount="25"> The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="37" wdcount="14"> The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S. retail trade.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="38" wdcount="11"> Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="39" wdcount="20"> Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had are involved with the company in various capacities.</s>
<s docid="AP890323-0234" num="40" wdcount="28"> Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with leukemia, now in remission.</s>

<s docid="AP890615-0263" num="13" wdcount="21"> Walton often attends promotional events for his Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the boss might make an appearance.</s>
<s docid="AP890615-0263" num="14" wdcount="8"> Walton continued talking with customers during the concert.</s>
<s docid="AP890615-0263" num="15" wdcount="18"> He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer.</s>
<s docid="AP890615-0263" num="16" wdcount="23"> ``He was up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and the customers went right along with him,'' Sively said.</s>
<s docid="AP890615-0263" num="17" wdcount="9"> ``He even got down to do a cheerleader's squiggle.''</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="9" wdcount="31"> He's ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="10" wdcount="18"> ``He's just a part of the community,'' said Curt Loyd, executive director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="11" wdcount="4"> ``He's a neat person.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="12" wdcount="10"> He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us''.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="13" wdcount="30"> Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the world's top billionaires.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="14" wdcount="23"> According to Forbes magazine's July 24 edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="15" wdcount="28"> ``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain, based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="16" wdcount="18"> Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="17" wdcount="16"> Shinkle said news coverage about Walton ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for comments from him.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="18" wdcount="7"> But the 71-year-old businessman declined to comment.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="19" wdcount="25"> ``He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,'' Shinkle said.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="20" wdcount="8"> ``He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="21" wdcount="12"> It just puts him in a position he doesn't want to be''.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="22" wdcount="9"> But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal modesty.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="23" wdcount="37"> Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="24" wdcount="5"> Walton then changed the subject.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="25" wdcount="14"> Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in October 1985.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="26" wdcount="11"> Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's wealthiest people.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="27" wdcount="11"> Walton made that listing as the richest American every year since.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="28" wdcount="9"> This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese businessmen.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="29" wdcount="30"> Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than 1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="30" wdcount="15"> He is out of the office up to four days a week, the spokesman said.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="31" wdcount="23"> ``He spends most of his time talking to associates and customers,'' Shinkle said, ``and he always comes back with many ideas from them''.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="32" wdcount="9"> Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="33" wdcount="29"> When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans, recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="34" wdcount="17"> ``They wanted to know about the stock and the company,'' said Simpson, who works for Stephens Inc.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="35" wdcount="14"> ``You'd think that he'd be living in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="36" wdcount="6"> But now people just accept it.</s>
<s docid="AP890711-0223" num="37" wdcount="14"> ``When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,''' Simpson said .</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="7" wdcount="26"> Forty years after Sam Walton first hung out his shingle, Walton's 5&10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="8" wdcount="25"> Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Visitors Center opens Wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where Walton first opened for business on May 9, 1950.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="9" wdcount="16"> The center chronicles the rise of the nation's fastest-growing discount chain, using displays and audio-video presentations.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="10" wdcount="17"> It concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="11" wdcount="23"> The window displays date back to the store's opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="12" wdcount="11"> Inside, an electronic map details the company's 1,500-plus store chain today.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="13" wdcount="37"> Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his ``dance on Wall Street,'' which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="14" wdcount="7"> The goal was accomplished and he danced.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="15" wdcount="22"> The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of Detroit.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="16" wdcount="13"> Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="17" wdcount="22"> Both will be on hand for the opening, along with a sprinkling of other dignitaries, including Gov. Bill Clinton, the dedication speaker.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="18" wdcount="29"> Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also has a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store, including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="19" wdcount="19"> Also on display is a photograph of young Sam Walton, a fat-faced baby born in Oklahoma in the 1920s.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="20" wdcount="24"> Typical of the Wal-Mart outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed ``a place to grow and to dream'' in a video on the Walton family.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="21" wdcount="20"> After a stint with J.C. Penney Co. and the Army, he opened a Ben Franklin store in Newport in 1945.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="22" wdcount="11"> He lost the lease on that one, and relocated to Bentonville.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="23" wdcount="6"> That's where the story took off.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="24" wdcount="22"> Sam Walton convinced Bob Bogle, then a public health officer, to take over management of his Bentonville Ben Franklin store in 1955.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="25" wdcount="37"> Walton ``said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores'' and needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent interview.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="26" wdcount="13"> That's when Bogle found himself in Walton's ``learn as you go'' training program.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="27" wdcount="18"> ``I got home at 10 o'clock that night after scrubbing and waxing the floor with Sam,'' Bogle said.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="28" wdcount="8"> Inauspicious first impressions are part of the story.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="29" wdcount="33"> In one video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="30" wdcount="9"> The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="31" wdcount="30"> ``I thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount store, or retail store, I have ever seen,'' said Glass, who was president of a drugstore chain at the time.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="32" wdcount="36"> And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there ``just really didn't see a future in it''.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="33" wdcount="52"> Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its ``associates'' _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the ``right person at the right time''.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="34" wdcount="17"> At the start of 1990, Wal-Mart owned 1,402 stores, employed 272,000 and listed sales of $25.8 billion.</s>
<s docid="AP900507-0207" num="35" wdcount="20"> Sam's Wholesale Club closed out the year with 123 units and Wal-Mart announced plans to enter the California market .</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="6" wdcount="11"> SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="7" wdcount="33"> The son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="8" wdcount="28"> By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="9" wdcount="15"> Wal-Mart now operates in 43 US states, selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="10" wdcount="16"> The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="11" wdcount="41"> He was a frugal, modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his Bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff, whom he insisted on calling 'associates'.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="12" wdcount="21"> He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable management buzz-words.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="13" wdcount="26"> Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Walton philosophy.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="14" wdcount="27"> He buoyed staff morale with cheer-leading sessions, bonus payments for good performance and profit-sharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="15" wdcount="28"> Eight years ago, when Wal-Mart's profits were better than expected, he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grass-skirt to dance the hula on Wall Street.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="16" wdcount="29"> Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume, cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="17" wdcount="6"> 'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="18" wdcount="24"> Mr Walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small, rural towns of the US south.</s>
<s docid="FT922-14265" num="19" wdcount="44"> It was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business, though in the process Wal-Mart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores, prompting bitter resistance in some towns which Mr Walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations .</s>

<s docid="FT923-5068" num="11" wdcount="29"> When, in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by chicken farmers, where Walton made his home.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5068" num="17" wdcount="12"> The worst that has been said is that he was rather dull.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="18" wdcount="8"> Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="19" wdcount="19"> Readers will either find his autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if charming, anecdotes.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="20" wdcount="8"> Or they will find it dreary and downbeat.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="21" wdcount="36"> Walton makes no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate . . . '.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="22" wdcount="9"> A few snippets are more revealing about the character.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5068" num="23" wdcount="27"> There cannot be many billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5068" num="25" wdcount="36"> In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing his rival's stock.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5068" num="28" wdcount="29"> Explaining the annual contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets for carrying bait.</s>

Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="7" wdcount="22"> Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="8" wdcount="36"> The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="9" wdcount="35"> His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="10" wdcount="12"> What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="11" wdcount="28"> Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="12" wdcount="38"> At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="13" wdcount="19"> Ten years later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="14" wdcount="23"> Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="15" wdcount="9"> Within another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="16" wdcount="18"> Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death, however, published material about the company is curiously scarce.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="17" wdcount="32"> This book attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining how it was achieved.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="18" wdcount="15"> One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt from other retailers.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="19" wdcount="7"> Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="20" wdcount="39"> Rather, he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="21" wdcount="40"> Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling everything they needed.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="22" wdcount="7"> Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="23" wdcount="36"> As early as the 1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to do to the end of his life.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="24" wdcount="44"> Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs - long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="25" wdcount="15"> This technology helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="26" wdcount="21"> But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management structure.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="27" wdcount="43"> Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting every Friday.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="28" wdcount="25"> They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="29" wdcount="29"> District managers hold a conference call with their store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="30" wdcount="28"> The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation begin the following week.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="31" wdcount="9"> Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="32" wdcount="40"> One was Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976 after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="33" wdcount="14"> Another was Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for gigantist America.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="34" wdcount="26"> Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street if Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="35" wdcount="5"> It did, and he did.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="36" wdcount="22"> The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the economies of small US towns was positive or negative.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="37" wdcount="23"> If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="38" wdcount="27"> Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the US.</s>
<s docid="FT944-12170" num="39" wdcount="19"> But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in building his own American dream .</s>

<s docid="FT923-5589" num="6" wdcount="47"> WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-four scale, four being most severe) was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial markets.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="7" wdcount="39"> On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="8" wdcount="46"> The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold; and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades, the currency dropped to DM1.40.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="9" wdcount="8"> This was its lowest-ever point against the D-mark.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="10" wdcount="17"> The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="11" wdcount="23"> Interest rate differentials between US and Germany widened over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbank tightened, their respective monetary policies.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="12" wdcount="25"> The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="13" wdcount="30"> So, too, was the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in a re-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for the incumbent.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="14" wdcount="38"> Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction - down.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="15" wdcount="30"> While there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="16" wdcount="14"> There are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="17" wdcount="16"> The first is that it raises import prices and, as a result, adds to inflationary pressures.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="18" wdcount="39"> The second is that it makes it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="19" wdcount="45"> The first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account for not much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is now around 3 per cent and heading lower.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="20" wdcount="6"> The second explanation carries more weight.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="21" wdcount="43"> Although there is not much chance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed will raise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policy again.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="22" wdcount="25"> The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="23" wdcount="16"> But investors in stocks were equally, if not more, troubled by the rise in bond yields.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="24" wdcount="36"> Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy, looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="25" wdcount="31"> The dollar put paid to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it was approaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-important mortgage rate for home-buyers.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="26" wdcount="30"> The dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week, and the devastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed, although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="27" wdcount="24"> The stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="28" wdcount="27"> But the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and Progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="29" wdcount="29"> The flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="30" wdcount="21"> Since there are an estimated 250,000 people left homeless by the storm, there is a lot of work to be done.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5589" num="31" wdcount="28"> The biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by Lennar, Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the largest maker of pre-manufactured homes in the US .</s>

<s docid="FT923-5797" num="8" wdcount="35"> However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.</s>

<s docid="FT923-5835" num="7" wdcount="52"> Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, said: 'On the basis of emerging information, General Accident advise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed'.</s>
<s docid="FT923-5835" num="8" wdcount="24"> What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6038" num="7" wdcount="36"> HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans.</s>
<s docid="FT923-6038" num="8" wdcount="38"> The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.</s>
<s docid="FT923-6038" num="9" wdcount="42"> Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.</s>
<s docid="FT923-6038" num="10" wdcount="30"> In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6038" num="12" wdcount="11"> Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land.</s>
<s docid="FT923-6038" num="13" wdcount="19"> By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph.</s>
<s docid="FT923-6038" num="14" wdcount="31"> Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas.</s>
<s docid="FT923-6038" num="15" wdcount="21"> The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6110" num="16" wdcount="33"> New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north.</s>

<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="12" wdcount="23"> Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate Europe.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="13" wdcount="24"> ``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years,'' says West German conservative lawmaker Eduard Lintner.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="14" wdcount="18"> ``We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago''.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="15" wdcount="27"> The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="16" wdcount="35"> Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and something short of a categorical ``no'' from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="17" wdcount="8"> The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="18" wdcount="43"> ``If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany,'' added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="19" wdcount="43"> The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II.</s>

<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="38" wdcount="13"> Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="39" wdcount="26"> ``In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,'' wrote commentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="40" wdcount="39"> ``The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed''.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="41" wdcount="36"> Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a ``hypothesis that cannot be excluded''.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="42" wdcount="25"> As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country in near-record numbers.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="43" wdcount="24"> More than 100,000 East Germans are expected to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="44" wdcount="21"> Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the 77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="45" wdcount="19"> During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="46" wdcount="19"> ``Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water,'' Honecker added on the issue of reunification.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="47" wdcount="20"> There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="48" wdcount="30"> The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="49" wdcount="33"> ``After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,'' member of Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="50" wdcount="31"> The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic Party.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="51" wdcount="10"> ``Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.</s>
<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="52" wdcount="19"> Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to disturb her sleep,'' Maier predicted in 1955.</s>

<s docid="AP890925-0009" num="54" wdcount="33"> Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: ``I love Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.''</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="9" wdcount="35"> The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="10" wdcount="32"> The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state, drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and others.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="11" wdcount="36"> But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="12" wdcount="34"> ``No one really wants German unity except the East German people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor,'' says Hyland, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="13" wdcount="40"> It was just 2 months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than 50 million people.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="14" wdcount="27"> While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="15" wdcount="19"> The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.</s>

<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="17" wdcount="27"> As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it, the reunification issue will become ``very, very active'' if a freely elected government takes power in East Germany.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="18" wdcount="16"> That possibility has been mentioned by East German leaders as part of the ongoing reform process.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="19" wdcount="29"> Brzezinski asks: ``How do we arrange for the unification of Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a threat to Germany's neighbors _ France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?</s>

<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="23" wdcount="33"> Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to President John F. Kennedy when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, says he hopes a reunited Germany will be forged as part of a reunited Europe.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="24" wdcount="19"> Reunification, Sorenson says, ``will pose problems, because we couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany outside the Western Alliance.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="25" wdcount="16"> The Soviet Union couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany as part of the Western Alliance.</s>

<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="34" wdcount="30"> The Bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling of NATO under any circumstances but, according to Hyland, the reunification of Germany could mean the demise of the alliance.</s>
<s docid="AP891111-0064" num="35" wdcount="25"> ``It may also mean the end of Western European unity, because both have been based on a divided Germany and a divided Europe,'' Hyland says.</s>
